# AutoML_Biocehmistry

## Project intro
This paper seeks to identify whether the analysis of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) signals
using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) will enable the use of
biomedical applications in recognising the presence of certain bacteria in infected
wounds. Auto Machine Learning (AutoML) is used in this report to determine
the most appropriate model for the data, firstly looking into the specific strain
of bacteria for each sample and then focusing on the medium used for each
sample.


## Status
Complete



## Technology used
- Python
- Tpot AutoML
- Jupyter notebook
- scikit-learn (random forest classifier



## Results

The results from the baseline system and
AutoML system using the strain as labels shows an increase in accuracy of
predicting the correct strain while using AutoML. The baseline returned 76%
to an improved 89% with AutoML.
